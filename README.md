# Welcome to Bookbot

We're building Book Bot - a Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of the word and character usage found within. Our learning goals are to:
- Configure a professional Python development environment on your local computer
- Practice building a full project from scratch
- Deploy a Python project on your personal GitHub account
- Learn how to use a professional code editor (VS Code)

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
